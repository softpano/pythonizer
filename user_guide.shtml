<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>Some organizations are now involved in converting their old Perl codebase into other scripting languages, such as Python. But a more common task is to maintain existing 
Perl scripts, when the person who is assigned to this task known only Python. </p>

<p>University graduates now typically know Python but not Perl and that creates difficulties in the old codebase maintenance. &nbsp; 
In this case, a program that &quot;explains&quot; Perl constructs in Python term would be extremely useful and, sometimes, a lifesaver. Of 
course, Perl 5 is here to stay (please note what happened with people who were predicting the demise of Fortran ;-), and in most 
cases, old scripts will stay too.</p>

<p>The other role is to give a quick start for system administrators who want to learn Python (for example, need to support 
researchers who work with Python), but who currently knows only Perl -- many older school sysadmins dislike Python and for a reason 
;-)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Yes another role is provide a proof that those two languages are mostly compatible and that program from one&nbsp; can be 
translated into another with modest amount of effort. Although such translation is not necessary a best fit,&nbsp; in most cases it 
is close enough and needs just minor manual editing.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Of course, complex constructs and idioms are often translated incorrectly. Several complex issues remains unresolved (implicit 
conversion to strings in Perl is one such issues.) As experience with Google translation of natural languages attests there&nbsp; 
are always around 10 to 20% of sentences (depending of the subject area of the text)&nbsp; that are translated incorrectly. And, 
probably,&nbsp; 2-3% that have absurd or funny translation.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The idea here is that using &quot;fuzzy translation&quot; concept it is possible to create such a tool with relatively modest efforts. A tool, written with some knowledge of 
compiler technologies, that falls into the category of &quot;small language compliers&quot; with the total effort around one man-year or less. Assuming ten lines per day of debugged code for the task of complexity comparable with the writing of compilers, the estimated 
size should be around 3-5K lines of code (~1K line phase 1 and 2-3K line phase 2).</p>

<p>As of version&nbsp; 0.8 it looks like the initial idea was a sound one: within&nbsp;5K LOC limit it is possible to create a 
useful utility that transcribes Perl in Python with a decent quality. </p>

<p>As the currently code base exceeded 4K lines, it is close to the&nbsp; limit on which I can maintain this codebase as a hobby project, so 
some enhancements need to be abandoned or moved to the pre-pythonizer phase.&nbsp; This&nbsp; first of all is true about insertion 
of proper conversion of&nbsp;&nbsp; types. Right now it is left to the programmer to fix those issues.&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>NOTE: </em>Pythonizer now&nbsp; creates the list of variables that need to be declared global to preserve a part of the 
global namespace that Perl subroutines access. This is a needed function as Python has different rules of variables visibility -- 
global variables are visible in all subroutines, but to be able to modify them you need to declare them global explicitly (and this 
global variable should already exist and be initialized) </p>

<h3><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h3>

<p>For testing the main program and all modules should reside in a single directory from which you can run the program.&nbsp; </p>

<p>You need to download files or replicate the directory via git&nbsp;. Let's assume that you downloaded or replicated them into&nbsp;
<tt>/home/softpano/Pythonizer</tt><tt> </tt></p>

<p>After that you can run <tt>pythonizer</tt> from the install directory by specifying&nbsp; <tt>-I /home/softpano/Pythonizer</tt>&nbsp; option for Perl interpreter 
to point to proper directory with modules &nbsp; 
For example:</p>

<pre class="code">perl -I /home/softpano/Pythonizer ~/Pythonizer/pythonizer script_to_be_translated.pl</pre>

<p>Alternatively you can specify PERL5LIB env variable to point to this directory</p>
<font SIZE="3">

<pre class="code">export PERL5LIB=<tt>/home/softpano/Pythonizer</tt></font></pre>

<p>If you already have this variable defined in your bashrc you can add this directory to the end after column, for example</p>

<pre class="code">PERL5LIB=/home/softpano/perl5/lib/:<font SIZE="3">PERL5LIB=</font><tt>/home/softpano/Pythonizer</tt></pre>

<p>After that you do not need to use option -I of Perl interpreter and can invoke the program directly</p>

<pre class="code">~/Pythonizer/pythonizer script_to_be_tranlated.pl</pre>

<p>In order to specify <tt>pythonizer</tt> without path you need to add the directory in which you installed it to the <tt>PATH </tt>
or copy the program to one of the directories already in <tt>PATH</tt>, for example<tt> /use/local/bin i</tt>f you are root<tt> or 
~/bin </tt>if you are a regular user<tt>.</tt></p>

<p style="text-align: left">Version 0.8 has a simpler installer using which&nbsp; you&nbsp; can quickly move the main&nbsp; script 
and module to proper places in your directory tree. It is called <tt>installer</tt> and accept two arguments:</p>
<ul>

   <li>

   <p style="text-align: left"><b>path_to_pythonizer</b> -- directory in which you want to put <tt>pythonizer</tt> and <tt>
   pre_pythonizer.pl</tt></li>

<li>

<p style="text-align: left"><b>path_to_modules</b> -- directory in which you want to put modules (should be defined iether in <tt>@INC</tt> 
or in env variable <tt>PERL5LIB</tt>)&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left">For example: </p>

<pre style="text-align: left" class="code">installer path_to_pythinizer parth_to_moduldes</pre>

<p style="text-align: left">for example </p>

<pre style="text-align: left" class="code">cd /opt/Pythonizer &amp;&amp; installer /user/local/bin /user /usr/local/share/perl5</pre>

<p>By default if run as root it assumes <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> as the target directory for pythonizer and<tt> /usr/local/share/perl5</tt> 
for modules if is is run as root<p>If run as a regular user defaults are&nbsp; <tt>~/bin</tt> and <tt>~/Perl5/lib</tt>

<h3><a name="Invocation">Invocation</a></h3>

<p>You can run Pythonizer both in Cygwin and Linux. To &quot;pythonize&quot; the Perl script you need to set <font SIZE="3">
directory with modules in -I option&nbsp; of Perl interpreter, PERL5LIB, or to put modules in some directory already in @INC as 
discussed in the <a href="#Installation">Installation</a> section.</font></p>

<p>The simplest&nbsp; invocation can look like: <font SIZE="3">&nbsp;</font></p>

<pre><font SIZE="3">export PERL5LIB=</font>/opt/Pythonizer &amp;&amp; /opt/Pythonizer/pythonizer /path/to/your/program/script_to_be_transalted.pl</pre>

<p>If the program runs to the end you will get &quot;pythonized&quot; text in <tt>/path/to/your/program.py</tt></p>

<p>It also produces protocol of translation in <tt>/tmp/Pythonizer</tt>&nbsp; with size by side Perl and Python code, which allows you to 
analyses the protocol detect places that need to be commented out translated 
manually. </p>

<p>If <tt>&nbsp;__DATA__</tt> or <tt>__END__</tt> are used a separate file with&nbsp; the extension&nbsp; <b>.data </b>&nbsp;(<tt>/path/to/your/program.data </tt>
for the example above) will be created with&nbsp; the content on this section of Perl script.</p>

<h3><a name="Pre-pythonizer__implements_the_first_phase_of_translation">Pre-pythonizer&nbsp; implements the first phase of 
translation</a></h3>

<p>Processing consists of two passes, which currently are not integrated in any away with <tt>pre_pythonizer</tt> mainly providing 
refactoring of Perl code to create <tt>main</tt> procedure and move all subroutines up so that they are now defined before use.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Running this phase also reformat the Perl script in a way that slightly increases chances that the script will be translated with 
fewer errors. Opening and closeting curvy bracket are put on single lines to ease the job of the lexical scanner in Pythonizer. </p>

<p>It can be used 
iether as separate utility of in integrated way via <tt>-r</tt> (<b><i>refactor</i></b>) option in pythonizer. </p>

<pre>pre_pythonizer [options] &lt;file&gt;  # currently performs is refactoring of  Perl script, 
                                 # pushing subroutines to the top and creating <tt>main</tt> sub
                                 # out of code not included  into any subroutine. 
pythonizer [options] &lt;file&gt;</pre>

<p>The first pass is currently fully optional and need transformations of Perl code can be performed by other utilities. 
It just slightly increase probability of more correct translation of the code. It reformat the code so that 
curvy brackets were mostly on separate lines (this was essential only for pythonizer up to version 0.2; later versions&nbsp;do not depend 
directly on this transformation.) </p>

<p>It can be used as a separate program, which transforms initial Perl script creating a backup with the extension <tt>.original.</tt> 
The main useful function in the current version is refactoring of the Perl program by pushing subroutines up as in Python 
subroutines needs to be declared before use. </p>

<p>It needs to run only once for each Perl script you want to translate to Python. Subsequence modifications of Perl script to make 
it more &quot;Python-compatible&quot; can be performed on this text instead of the original script. </p>

<h3><a name="Pythonizer_implements_actual_transformation_of_Perl_into_Python">Pythonizer implements actual transformation of Perl 
into Python</a></h3>

<p>Running&nbsp; <tt>pythonizer -h</tt> provides a&nbsp; list of options. </p>

<p>Here is example of the protocol&nbsp;
<a href="protocol_of_translation_of_pre_pythonizer020.shtml">Full protocol of translation of pre_pythonizer.pl by version 0.2 of 
pythonizer</a></p>

<p>To increase chances of correct translation it is recommended to run the Perl script via

<p><span class="css-truncate css-truncate-target d-block width-fit">Parts that can't be translated during the first invocation can 
be commented outs and iteratively you can modify simplify Perl code and reach the stage when the Perl script is translated more or 
less OK. After that you can work in Python debugger and iron remaining inconsistencies and cases of incorrect translation of 
statements. Sometimes algorithm of a part of the program need to be adapted to Python.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><b><span class="css-truncate css-truncate-target d-block width-fit">Some features:</span></b></p>

<ul class="simple">

   <li>The Pythonizer is implemented in Perl 5.10+ and does not use any non standard Perl libraries. </li>

   <li>Converts most of Perl 5 code typical for sysadmin scripts into Python. That includes loops, special variables, function 
   calls, lists, hashes,&nbsp; etc.</li>

   <li>Recognizes some Perl idioms and special cases. Perform limited peophole optimization of Perl within individual statements in case this is possible (for example use 
   of replace function&nbsp; instead or regular expression in&nbsp; case both the source and target are plain strings. it also optimize some types of split function when the regex supplied to Perl actually is a string and does not contain any 
   metacharacters. </li>

   <li>Whenever there is no equivalent Python function for a Perl function, the function is emulated. Currently this is done only in 
   cases when this does not require additional Python library.</li>

   <li>Perl special variables are renamed to selected Python names and used consistently. But that does not mean that they are 
   correctly populated. </li>

   <li>Limited translation of double quoted literals with scalars inside list elements and hash elements and ‘here-documents’ is 
   supported. Most common special variable are also translated to their equivalents in double quoted operators. </li>

   <li>Arguments to Perl subroutines are emulated via lists</li>

   <li>In case of Perl control constructs that are missing in Python (for example <tt>(debug&gt;0) &amp;&amp; say $line</tt>; or <tt>open(SYSIN,'&lt;',',$mytext) 
   || die(&quot;Can't open the file $mytest\n&quot;);<span lang="ru">) </tt></span>they are translated into equivalent Python 
   constructs. There are some exceptions, for example Perl <tt>continue</tt> statement, but they are rarely used. </li>

   <li>Tail data after <tt>__DATA__</tt> or <tt>__END__ </tt>&nbsp;are converted to a separate file with the same name as script and<tt> 
   .data</tt></li>

   <li>List of statements for which pythonizer encountered difficulties and most probably did not translate correctly are produced 
   at the end. </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Limitations">Limitations</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">

   <li>No OO constructs&nbsp; such as <tt>bless</tt> and <tt>package</tt> statement are translated.&nbsp; The <tt>use</tt> statement and import 
   and expert of variables from modules also need to be translated manually.&nbsp; </li>

   <li>The content of&nbsp; ‘BEGIN’, ‘END’ blocks is translated but blocks itself need to be emulated manually.&nbsp; Please note 
   that these blocks are executed at the time of execution of Perl interpreter, not at the time of execution of&nbsp; the script, so 
   opportunities to match Perl semantic here are limited.&nbsp; </li>

   <li>References are not translated correctly. In many cases of usage of references in Perl this is very difficult to&nbsp; express 
   in Python </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Options">Options</a></h3>

<p><em>NOTE: </em>All options with small numeric values can be expressed by&nbsp; repeating the letter, so<tt> -p 2</tt> is equivalent to <tt>-pp.</tt> 
<tt>-d 3 -ddd</tt></p>

<p>Currently only few user options are supported (<tt>pythonizer -h</tt> provides a&nbsp; list of options):&nbsp; </p>
<ul>

   <li><tt>-p</tt> -- The version of Python used for generation. Default is 3.8 (can be set explicitly by specifying <tt>-p 3</tt>) 
   You can set 2.7 by using&nbsp; <tt>-p 2</tt></li>

   <li><tt>-v</tt> -- verbosity <tt>-v 0</tt> -minimal verbosity <tt>-v 3</tt> -- max verbosity; can also be expresses as <tt>-v <tt>
   </tt>-vv</tt> and <tt>-vvv </tt>-- forms to which Unix user got used in other utilities</li>

   <li><tt>-t</tt>&nbsp; -- tab size for generated code; the default<tt> -t 4</tt> </li>

   <li><tt>-r</tt> -- refactor Perl code. If specified, before processing the script by the pythonizer, it&nbsp; invokes the <tt>
   pre_pythonizer</tt> 
   preliminary pass on the source code. Of course this can be&nbsp; done manually 
   with&nbsp; more control but this provides an integrated way to refactor the program. </li>

<p>State variable are now simply mapped to global namespace which can create conflicts and corrupt their value at run time.&nbsp; So

<h4>[Sep 18, 2020] <a href="https://github.com/softpano/pythonizer">Version&nbsp; 0.7 uploaded</a> </h4>
<blockquote>

   <p><b>Changes since version 0.6</b></p>

   <p>This version creates of the list of global variables for each subroutine to maintain the same visibility in Python as in Perl 
   and generates <tt>global</tt> statement with the list of such&nbsp; variables that is inserted in each Python subroutine 
   definition if pythonizer determined that this subroutine access global variables. </p>

   <p>So far the specifics of Perl <tt>state</tt> variable is ignored and they are assumed to be yet another type of global 
   variables (they generally do not belong to the global namespace as while they have lifetime similar to global variables their 
   namespace is local). </p>

<blockquote>

   <p>Regular expressions now are translated more&nbsp; correctly. Short cut if like <tt>(debug&gt;0) &amp;&amp; say $line</tt> are translated 
   in more general way then before.&nbsp; This is the first version that translates the main test (pre_pythonizer.pl) without syntax 
   errors. Generated source&nbsp; starts executing in Python interpreter till the first error. List on internal functions created. 
   Translation of backquotes and open statement improved. </p>
